Okay, here's a long message for you to test with:

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is a classic pangram, meaning it contains every letter of the alphabet. Pangrams are often used to test typewriters, fonts, and other systems that need to display the full range of characters. But beyond their practical uses, pangrams can also be quite fun. Consider the challenge of creating a pangram that is also grammatically correct and makes some kind of sense. It's not as easy as it sounds! You have to be creative and think outside the box to incorporate all 26 letters in a way that flows naturally. Some people even turn it into a game, competing to see who can come up with the most original and interesting pangram. The possibilities are endless, limited only by your imagination. So, the next time you see the phrase "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog," remember that it's more than just a random sentence; it's a testament to the power of language and the human desire to find patterns and meaning in everything we do. Furthermore, the use of pangrams extends beyond simple testing. They can be incorporated into educational materials to help students learn the alphabet and improve their vocabulary. They can also be used in cryptography as a way to test the strength of encryption algorithms. In the digital age, where communication is increasingly reliant on technology, the humble pangram continues to play a vital role in ensuring that our messages are clear, accurate, and accessible to all. And finally, let's not forget the sheer joy of discovering a new and clever pangram. It's a small but satisfying moment that reminds us of the beauty and complexity of language.

Alright, here's another long message for your testing purposes:

Imagine a world where the sky is always a vibrant shade of cerulean, the trees whisper secrets in the wind, and the rivers flow with liquid moonlight. In this world, the inhabitants are beings of pure energy, capable of manipulating reality with their thoughts. They live in harmony with nature, respecting the delicate balance of the ecosystem. Their cities are built from living plants, constantly evolving and adapting to the needs of the community. There is no concept of ownership or scarcity, as everything is shared freely among all. The pursuit of knowledge and understanding is the highest calling, and the beings spend their days exploring the mysteries of the universe. They communicate through telepathy, sharing their thoughts and emotions directly with one another. There is no deception or malice, only pure, unadulterated love and compassion. They have mastered the art of healing, able to mend any physical or emotional wound with a touch. They travel through space and time, visiting distant galaxies and witnessing the birth and death of stars. They are the guardians of the universe, protecting it from any threat that may arise. They are the embodiment of peace, wisdom, and enlightenment. This world may seem like a fantasy, but it serves as a reminder of the potential for good that exists within us all. It challenges us to strive for a better future, where we can live in harmony with nature and with one another. It inspires us to embrace our creativity, our compassion, and our capacity for love. And it reminds us that anything is possible if we dare to dream. The very fabric of their existence is interwoven with the cosmos, each individual a thread in the grand tapestry of creation. Their understanding of quantum physics transcends our current comprehension, allowing them to manipulate the very building blocks of reality. They are not merely observers of the universe, but active participants in its ongoing evolution.

Okay, I understand. You have some code that handles responses from an AI model, and you want to simplify the logic to handle both streaming and non-streaming responses more cleanly. Specifically, you want to:

1.  Check if the response from `promptModel` is a stream.
2.  If it's a stream, process it chunk by chunk, appending each chunk to the chat file and updating the Neovim buffer.
3.  If it's *not* a stream (i.e., a complete string), wait for the entire response, then format it and append it to the chat file.
4.  Avoid duplicating the `appendToChat` call when streaming.
5.  Handle potential errors during streaming.

Here's a revised version of your code that addresses these points:

```javascript
nvim.on('notification', async (method, args) => {
    if (method === 'prompt_action' && args[0] === 'submit_pressed') {
        const buffer = await nvim.buffer;
        const lines = await buffer.lines;

        // Get the full conversation history
        const conversationHistory = lines.join('\n');
        const fullPrompt = conversationHistory + '\n';

        // Get AI response
        const responseStream = await promptModel(model, fullPrompt, temperature, aiRoles[role]);

        if (typeof responseStream === 'string') {
            // Handle non-streaming response
            const aiEntry = formatChatEntry(model, responseStream);
            await appendToChat(chatFile, aiEntry);
        } else {
            // Handle streaming response
            let fullResponse = '';
            try {
                for await (const chunk of responseStream) {
                    // Extract the text from the chunk
                    const text = chunk.text();
                    fullResponse += text;

                    // Append the text to the chat file
                    await appendToChat(chatFile, text);

                    // Refresh the buffer
                    await nvim.command('edit!');
                    await nvim.command('normal! G');
                    await nvim.command('normal! o');
                }

                // Format the full AI response after streaming is complete
                const formattedAiEntry = formatChatEntry(model, fullResponse); // Format the complete response
                // No need to append again, it's already been appended chunk by chunk
                // await appendToChat(model, formattedAiEntry);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error("Error during Gemini stream processing:", error);
                // Handle the error appropriately (e.g., display an error message to the user)
            }
        }
    }
});
```

Key changes and explanations:

*   **Simplified Conditional:** The `if (typeof responseStream === 'string')` condition clearly distinguishes between streaming and non-streaming responses.
*   **Streaming Logic:** The `for await...of` loop handles the streaming case. Each chunk is appended to the chat file and the Neovim buffer is updated.
*   **No Duplicate Append:** The `appendToChat(model, formattedAiEntry)` call *after* the streaming loop has been removed.  The streaming loop already appends each chunk to the chat file, so appending the entire formatted response again would duplicate the content.
*   **Error Handling:** The `try...catch` block remains to handle potential errors during streaming.
*   **Clarity:**  Comments have been added to explain the purpose of each section.

This revised code should be more readable and efficient, and it avoids the potential for duplicate content in your chat file when dealing with streaming responses. Let me know if you have any other questions.

You're right to point that out! In the revised code I provided, the `formattedAiEntry` is calculated within the streaming `try` block but then never actually used. This is a leftover from the original logic and an oversight on my part.

Here's why it's there and how we can address it:

*   **Original Intent:** The original code likely intended to format the *entire* AI response *after* the streaming was complete, possibly to add metadata or a consistent formatting style to the complete response.
*   **Current Problem:**  Since we're appending each chunk directly to the chat file during streaming, the `formattedAiEntry` becomes redundant. The chat file already contains the complete response, albeit without the potential formatting applied by `formatChatEntry`.

Here are a few options for what to do with `formattedAiEntry`, depending on your desired outcome:

**Option 1: Apply Formatting to Each Chunk (Most Consistent)**

If the goal is to have consistent formatting applied to *every* part of the AI's response, even during streaming, you should format each chunk *before* appending it.

```javascript
nvim.on('notification', async (method, args) => {
    if (method === 'prompt_action' && args[0] === 'submit_pressed') {
        const buffer = await nvim.buffer;
        const lines = await buffer.lines;

        // Get the full conversation history
        const conversationHistory = lines.join('\n');
        const fullPrompt = conversationHistory + '\n';

        // Get AI response
        const responseStream = await promptModel(model, fullPrompt, temperature, aiRoles[role]);

        if (typeof responseStream === 'string') {
            // Handle non-streaming response
            const aiEntry = formatChatEntry(model, responseStream);
            await appendToChat(chatFile, aiEntry);
        } else {
            // Handle streaming response
            let fullResponse = '';
            try {
                for await (const chunk of responseStream) {
                    // Extract the text from the chunk
                    const text = chunk.text();
                    fullResponse += text;

                    // Format the chunk
                    const formattedChunk = formatChatEntry(model, text);

                    // Append the formatted chunk to the chat file
                    await appendToChat(chatFile, formattedChunk);

                    // Refresh the buffer
                    await nvim.command('edit!');
                    await nvim.command('normal! G');
                    await nvim.command('normal! o');
                }

                // No need to format the full response again, it's already been formatted chunk by chunk
                // const formattedAiEntry = formatChatEntry(model, fullResponse);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error("Error during Gemini stream processing:", error);
                // Handle the error appropriately (e.g., display an error message to the user)
            }
        }
    }
});
```

**Option 2: Apply Formatting Only to Non-Streaming Responses (Simple but Inconsistent)**

Keep the code as is for streaming responses (appending raw chunks), and only apply the formatting to the complete response when it's *not* a stream. This is the simplest approach, but it means streaming responses will have a different format than non-streaming ones.

**Option 3: Accumulate, Format, and Append After Streaming (More Complex, Potentially Useful)**

If you *need* to format the *entire* response at once *after* streaming, you could accumulate the chunks in `fullResponse`, then format `fullResponse` *and then* append it to the chat file *once*, instead of appending each chunk individually.  This would require significant changes to the streaming loop.  You'd need to *remove* the `appendToChat(chatFile, text)` call from *inside* the loop and move it *after* the loop.  This is generally *not* recommended because it defeats the purpose of streaming (showing the user the response as it arrives).

**Recommendation:**

I recommend **Option 1** (formatting each chunk). It provides the most consistent formatting and leverages the streaming nature of the response.  It ensures that every part of the AI's response, whether it arrives in a stream or as a complete string, is formatted in the same way.

Choose the option that best aligns with your formatting requirements and the desired user experience. Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these options or provide more specific code examples.
